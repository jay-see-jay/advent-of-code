# Advent of Code

The solution to each day's puzzles are in their own package, with separate
implementations for part 1 and part 2.

To run the solution for each day call `go run` in the terminal with the number
of the day as the first argument and the part (either 1 or 2) as the second:

```
go run . 1 2
```

To run tests for all packages, call:

```
go test ./...
```
